# DAO Accounting

This dapp aims to be similar to a small Quickbooks for DAOs!

The client fetches the provided address' transactions on etherscan as well as displaying a monthly recap of expenses and income.

The most interesting part of this dapp is the ability categorize your transactions. This category is editable if you connect your wallet, and it matches the address that you queried.
